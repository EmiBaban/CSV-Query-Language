CSV Query Language
The CSV Query Language project is a Scala implementation of a basic query language for .csv tables. It demonstrates the use of both Functional and Object-Oriented programming patterns.

Features
Table.scala: Implementation of the Table class and case classes for queries and filter conditions.
TestTables.scala: Pre-made Table vals for testing purposes.
tables: Directory containing example .csv files.
Overview
The project provides functionality to manipulate .csv tables using a query language implemented in Scala. It includes classes for defining queries, filter conditions, and table operations.

Implementation
Table Class
The Table class represents a .csv table and provides methods for querying and manipulating the data. It utilizes functional and object-oriented programming paradigms to ensure efficient and flexible data processing.

Query Language
The query language allows users to perform operations such as selection, filtering, and merging on .csv tables. Queries are defined using case classes, providing a concise and expressive syntax.
